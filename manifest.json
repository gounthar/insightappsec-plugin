    "overview": "Integrate your Jenkins build and release pipelines with Rapid7 InsightAppSec scan data",
    "description": "The InsightAppSec Jenkins plugin provides an easy way to integrate your build process with the InsightAppSec REST API. Using this plugin, Jenkins can automatically run a scan against your web apps and make a decision about the pass/fail status of the build based on the scan result. This decision can be made by using different rules, for example, the presence of a vulnerability based on a search query.",
