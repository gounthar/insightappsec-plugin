# Description

The InsightAppSec Jenkins plugin provides an easy way to integrate your build process with the InsightAppSec REST API.
Using this plugin, Jenkins can automatically run a scan against your web apps and make a decision about the pass/fail
status of the build based on the scan result. This decision can be made by using different rules, for example, the
presence of a vulnerability based on a search query.

# Key Features

* Trigger scans from Jenkins
* Pass or fail builds based on scan results

# Requirements

* A user account on the Insight Platform with `Read Write` or `Admin` access.
* Access to InsightAppSec. Note that free trial users are unable to start a scan via the API and so may not use the plugin.

# Documentation
